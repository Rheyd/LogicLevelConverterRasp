# LogicLevelConverterRasp
logic level converter for raspberry pi (any version)
the logic level converter is intended to be used on the raspberry pi, but it can also be used in any system that requires bidirectional logic level conversion, like an FPGA board (which by the way works awesome, you've my word).
in the case of the raspberry pi, there's no need for an external power supply because the rasp gives the 3.3v and 5v supply. the note on the board about the 3.3v supply been disabled is because of the current limit, this power supply in the raspberry pi can only supply 30mA before to die D: nobody wants that, that's the reason.
